This is a quite straight forward readme file for pml2015.
Please double check the note in the R file:
Load all necessary Libraries
Get the train and test files
Make data clean and eliminate the null value since we will use RandomForest.
Partition data with 60% for training and 40% for testing
Use Random Forests algorithms for prediction.
Write the predictons generated in the previsou step into files.
