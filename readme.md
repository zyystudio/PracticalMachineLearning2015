This is a quite straight forward readme file for pml2015.
Please double check the note in the R file:
1.Load all necessary Libraries. 
2.Get the train and test files. 
3.Eliminate the null value since we will use RandomForest. 
4.Partition data with 60% for training and 40% for testing. 
5.Use Random Forests algorithms for prediction. 
6.Write the predictons generated in the previsou step into files.
